# article-geometric-errors-identification
This repository groups data and code used in my research, acquired by experiments conducted on a horziontal lathe

The experiment consisted on measuring geometric error of the machine axes through a measurement system, following the subsequent steps:

- Collectiing raw data experimentaly thorugh the instrumentation;
- Data misagnlignement correction through a regression model based on Least Squares;
- Data treatment through an error separation technique;
- Exploratory data analysis of the machine error;
- Normality and homogeneity of variances checked;
- Data transformation attempt;
- Statistical inference through Aligned Ranked Transform non-parametric procedure;
- Statistical inference through Analysis of Variance and Tukey test;
- Contrast tests to evaluate the significant differences;
- Simulation of a machining process.
